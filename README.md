  #### Primary Key 
  
  #### Foreign Key 
  
  #### Constraints 
  
  #### 1. SQL Basics : Data Retrieval 
-  Retrieve data using text query (SELECT, WHERE, DISTINCT, LIKE)
-  Retrieve data using numeric query (BETWEEN, IN , ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET)
-  Summary analytics : MIN, MAX, AVG, GROUP BY
-  Having clause

## Learnt things from this Project : 
This project marks the beginning of my SQL learning journey. It allowed me to learn & apply SQL concepts to real-world data analysis and gain practical experience.

Here are some of the highlights of what I learned and practiced during this fantastic journey:

✨ INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, and CROSS JOIN: Gained a solid understanding of different types of joins and how to effectively combine data from multiple tables.

✨ Subqueries and Correlated Subqueries: Explored the power of subqueries, understanding how they can be nested and correlated to handle complex queries efficiently.

✨ Common Table Expressions (CTE): Leveraging CTEs enhanced my query readability and learned to tackle complex problems step by step.

✨ User-Defined SQL Functions: I now have the skills to create custom functions to streamline repetitive tasks and improve overall code efficiency.

✨ Stored Procedures: Understanding the concept of stored procedures allowed me to modularize code and enhance database performance.

✨ Database Views: Grasped the significance of database views in simplifying complex queries and providing a structured interface to access data.

✨ Window Functions: Learned how to use the powerful OVER clause, along with functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK, to analyze data more effectively.

✨ Temporary Tables: Explored the use of temporary tables and their benefits in handling intermediate results during complex data operations.

✨ Database Normalization & Data Integrity 

✨ ETL Data Warehouse, OLTP, OLAP, Data Catalog

✨  Fact vs Dimension Table, Star vs Snowflake Schema 

✨  Simplified : What is Kanban
  
✨ Supply Chain Basics : Simplified
